# <Horiseon-semantic>

## Description

***The goal was fix all of the semantic issues in HTML code, consolidate CSS stylesheet,<br> add comments to images and CSS stylesheeet and debug the codes to make the website stable, responsive and accessible.***

I did learn how to:
- debug code made by someone else,  
- how to use proper semantic names in HTML,   
- reduce the amount of lines in CSS stylesheet, so it is more clear what's included in it,.  
- how to make the website's code more accessible and that it has an impact on the website's position in search engines,  
- how to comment images on the website,  
- how to make simple comments in css stylesheet,  
- to commit and push changes quite often to github, to prevent myself from having issues<br> with restoring the code(learnt hard way, as needed to make the whole homework 2 times).<hr>
